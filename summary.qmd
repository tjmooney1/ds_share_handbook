# The Data Science team 

## Where we sit
> The Data Science department are a fully global resource within the alliance

Capture Intelligence is our biggest internal "client" as there are plenty of opportunities to offer data science led services in the research offering of Capture. But also have our own core central pipe for development that supports *all* agency brands.

What this means is as a team we have responsibilities that range from continual development of our own tech stack to help answer specific research questions for external clients to helping empower members of the alliance to use mindful applications of emerging technologies.

The team is made up of:

**Mike Tapp**: Data Director

**Jack Penzer**: Global Data Product Lead

**Jamie Hudson**: Senior Data Scientist

**Aoife Ryan**: Data Scientist

**Tim Mooney**: Jr. Data Scientist

**Sophie Thomas**: Jr. Data Scientist
