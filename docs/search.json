    "section": "3.2 Overview of approach",
    "text": "3.2 Overview of approach\nPeaks and pits projects have gone through many iterations throughout the past year and a half. Currently, the general workflow is to use utilise a model framework known as SetFit to efficiently train a text classification model with limited training data. This fine-tuned model is then able to run inference over large datasets to label posts as either peaks, pits, or neither. We then utilise the LLM capabilities to refine these peak and pit moments into a collection of posts we are extremely confident are peaks and/or pits. We then employ topic modelling to identify groups of similar peaks and pits to help us organise and discover hidden topics or themes within this collection of core moments.\nThis whole process can be split into six distinct steps:\n\nExtract brand/product mentions from Sprinklr (the start of any project)\nObtain project-specific exemplar posts to help fine-tune a text classification model\nPerform model fine-tuning through contrastive learning\nRun inference over all of the project specific data\nUse GPT-3.5 for an extra layer of classification on identified peaks and pits\nTurn moments into something interpretable using topic modelling\n\n\n\n\nSchematic workflow from Project 706 - Peaks and Pits in M365 Apps\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Obtain posts for the project (Step 1)\nThis step relies on the analysts to export relevant mentions from Sprinklr (one of the social listening tools that analysts utilise to obtain social data), and therefore is not detailed much here. What is required is one dataset for each of the brands/products, so they can be analysed separately.\n\n\n3.2.2 Identify project-specific exemplar peaks and pits to fine-tune our ML model (Step 2)\nThis step is synonymous with data labelling required for any machine learning project where annotated data is not already available.\nWhilst there is no one-size-fits-all for determining the amount of data required to train a machine learning model, for traditional models and tasks, the number of examples per label is often in the region of thousands, and often this isn’t even enough for more complex problems.\nThe time required to accurately label thousands of peaks and pits to train a classification model in the traditional way is sadly beyond the scope of feasibility for our projects. As such we needed an approach that did not rely on copious amounts of pre-labelled data.\nThis is where SetFit comes in. As mentioned previously, SetFit is a framework that enables us to efficiently train a text classification model with limited training data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it do this?\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the below is directly copied from the SetFit documentation. It is so succinctly written that trying to rewrite it would not do it justice.\nEvery SetFit model consists of two parts: a sentence transformer embedding model (the body) and a classifier (the head). These two parts are trained in two separate phases: the embedding finetuning phase and the classifier training phase. This conceptual guide will elaborate on the intuition between these phases, and why SetFit works so well.\nEmbedding finetuning phase\nThe first phase has one primary goal: finetune a sentence transformer embedding model to produce useful embeddings for our classification task. The Hugging Face Hub already has thousands of sentence transformer available, many of which have been trained to very accurately group the embeddings of texts with similar semantic meaning.\nHowever, models that are good at Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) are not necessarily immediately good at our classification task. For example, according to an embedding model, the sentence of 1) “He biked to work.” will be much more similar to 2) “He drove his car to work.” than to 3) “Peter decided to take the bicycle to the beach party!”. But if our classification task involves classifying texts into transportation modes, then we want our embedding model to place sentences 1 and 3 closely together, and 2 further away.\nTo do so, we can finetune the chosen sentence transformer embedding model. The goal here is to nudge the model to use its pretrained knowledge in a different way that better aligns with our classification task, rather than making the completely forget what it has learned.\nFor finetuning, SetFit uses contrastive learning. This training approach involves creating positive and negative pairs of sentences. A sentence pair will be positive if both of the sentences are of the same class, and negative otherwise. For example, in the case of binary “positive”-“negative” sentiment analysis, (“The movie was awesome”, “I loved it”) is a positive pair, and (“The movie was awesome”, “It was quite disappointing”) is a negative pair.\nDuring training, the embedding model receives these pairs, and will convert the sentences to embeddings. If the pair is positive, then it will pull on the model weights such that the text embeddings will be more similar, and vice versa for a negative pair. Through this approach, sentences with the same label will be embedded more similarly, and sentences with different labels less similarly.\nConveniently, this contrastive learning works with pairs rather than individual samples, and we can create plenty of unique pairs from just a few samples. For example, given 8 positive sentences and 8 negative sentences, we can create 28 positive pairs and 64 negative pairs for 92 unique training pairs. This grows exponentially to the number of sentences and classes, and that is why SetFit can train with just a few examples and still correctly finetune the sentence transformer embedding model. However, we should still be wary of overfitting.\nClassifier training phase\nOnce the sentence transformer embedding model has been finetuned for our task at hand, we can start training the classifier. This phase has one primary goal: create a good mapping from the sentence transformer embeddings to the classes.\nUnlike with the first phase, training the classifier is done from scratch and using the labelled samples directly, rather than using pairs. By default, the classifier is a simple logistic regression classifier from scikit-learn. First, all training sentences are fed through the now-finetuned sentence transformer embedding model, and then the sentence embeddings and labels are used to fit the logistic regression classifier. The result is a strong and efficient classifier.\nUsing these two parts, SetFit models are efficient, performant and easy to train, even on CPU-only devices.\n\n\n\nThere is no perfect number of labelled examples to find per class (i.e. peak, pit, or neither). Whilst in general more exemplars (and hence more training data) is beneficial, having fewer but high quality labelled posts is far superior than more posts of poorer quality. This is extremely important due to the contrastive nature of SetFit where it’s superpower is making the most of few, extremely good, labelled data.\nOkay so now we know why we need labelled data, and we know what the model will do with it, what is our approach for obtaining the labelled data?\nBroadly, we use our human judgement to read a post from the current project dataset, and manually label whether we think it is a peak, a pit, or neither. To avoid us just blindly reading through random posts in the dataset in the hope of finding good examples (this is not a good use of time), we can employ a couple of tricks to narrow our search region to posts that have a reasonable likelihood of being suitable examples.\n\nThe first trick is to use the OpenAI API to access a GPT model. This involves taking a sample of posts (say ~1000) and running these through a GPT model, with a prompt that asks the model to classify each post into either a peak, pit, or neither. This is possible because GPT models have learned knowledge of peaks and pits from its training on large datasets. We can therefore get a human to only sense-check/label posts that GPT also believes are peaks or pits.\nThe second trick involves using a previously created SetFit model (i.e. from an older project), and running inference over a similar sample of posts (again, say ~1000).\n\nWe would tend to suggest the OpenAI route, as it is simpler to implement (in our opinion), and often the old SetFit model has been finetuned on data from a different domain so it might struggle to understand domain specific language in the current dataset. However, be aware if it not as scalable as using an old SetFit model and has the drawback of being a prompt based classification of a black-box model (as well as issues relating to cost and API stability).\nIrrespective of which approach is taken, by the end of this step we need to have a list of example posts we are confident represent what a peak or pit moment looks like for each particular product we are researching, including posts that are “neither”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we do this for each project?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter so many projects now don’t we already have a good idea of what a peak and pit moment for the purposes of model training?\nEach peak and pit project we work on has the potential to introduce ‘domain’ specific language, which a machine learning classifier (model) may not have seen before. By manually identifying exemplar peaks and pits that are project-specific, this gives our model the best chance to identify emotional moments appropriate to the project/data at hand.\nThe obvious case for this is with gaming specific language, where terms that don’t necessarily relate to an ‘obvious’ peak or pit moment could refer to one the gaming conversation, for example the terms/phrases “GG”, “camping”, “scrub”, and “goat” all have very specific meanings in this domain that differ from their use in everyday language.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Train our model using our labelled examples (Step 3)\nBefore we begin training our SetFit model with our data, it’s necessary to clean and wrangle the fine-tuning datasets. Specifically, we need to mask any mentions of brands or products to prevent bias. For instance, if a certain brand frequently appears in the training data within peak contexts, the model could erroneously link peak moments to that brand rather than learning the peak-language expressed in the text.\n\nThis precaution should extend to all aspects of our training data that might introduce biases. For example, as we now have examples from various projects, an overrepresentation of data from ‘gaming projects’ in our ‘peak’ posts within our training set (as opposed to the ‘pit’ posts) could skew the model into associating gaming-related language more with peaks than pits.\n\nBroadly the cleaning steps that should be applied to our data for finetuning are:\n\nMask brand/product mentions\nRemove hashtags #️⃣\nRemove mentions 💬\nRemove URLs 🌐\nRemove emojis 🐙\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about other cleaning steps?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will notice here we do not remove stop words-. As explained in the previous step, part of the finetuning process is to finetune a sentence embedding model, and we want to keep stop words so that we can use the full context of the post in order to finetune accurate embeddings.\n\n\n\nAt this step, we can split out our data into training, testing, and validation datasets. A good rule of thumb is to split the data 70% to training data, 15% to testing data, and 15% to validation data. By default, SetFit oversamples the minimum class within the training data, so we shouldn’t have to worry too much about imbalanced datasets- though be aware if we have extreme imbalanced we will end up sampling the same contrastive pairs (normally positive pairs) multiple times. However, our experimentation has shown that class imbalance doesn’t seem to have a significant effect to the training/output of the SetFit model for peaks and pits.\nWe are now at the stage where we can actually fine-tune the model. There are many different parameters we can change when fine-tuning the model, such as the specific embedding model used, the number of epochs to train for, the number of contrastive pairs of sentences to train on etc. For more details, please refer to the Peaks and Pits Playbook\nWe can assess model performance on the testing dataset by looking at accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. For peaks and pits, the most important metric is actually recall because in step 4 we reclassify posts using GPT, so we want to make sure we are able to provide as many true peak/pit moments as possible to this step, even if it means we also provide a few false positives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for more info as to why recall is most important\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a refresher, precision is the proportion of positive identifications that are actually correct (it focuses on the correctness of positive predictions) whereas recall is the proportion of actual positives that are identified correctly (it focuses on capturing all relevant instances).\nIn cases where false positives need to be minimised (incorrectly predicting a non-event as an event) we need to prioritise precision - if you’ve built a model to identify hot dogs from regular ol’ doggos, high precision ensures that normal dogs are not misclassified as hot dogs.\nIn cases where false negatives need to be minimised (failing to detect an actual event) we need to prioritise recall - in medical diagnoses we need to minimise the number of times a patient is incorrectly told they do not have a disease when in reality they do (or worded differently, we need to ensure that all patients with a disease are identified).\nTo apply this to our problem- we want to be sure that we capture all (or as many as possible) relevant instances of peaks or pits- even if a few false positives come in (neither posts that are incorrectly classified as peaks or pits). As we use GPT to make further peak/pit identifications, it’s better to provide GPT with with a comprehensive set of potential peaks and pits, including some incorrect ones, than to miss out on critical data.\n\n\n\n\nVisualise model separation\nAs a bonus, we can actually neatly visualise how well our finetuning of the sentence transformer embedding model has gone- by seeing how well the model is able to separate our different classes in embedding space.\nWe can do this by visualising the 2-D structure of the embeddings and see how they cluster:\nThis is what it looks the embeddings space looks like on an un-finetuned model:\n\n\n\nUn-finetuned embedding model\n\n\nHere we can see that posts we know are peaks, pits, and neither all overlap and there is no real structure in the data. Any clustering of points observed are probably due to the posts’ semantic similarity (c.f. the mode of transport example above). We would not be able to nicely use a classifier model to get a good mapping from this embedding space to our classes (i.e. we couldn’t easily separate classes here).\nBy visualising the same posts after finetuning the embedding model, we get something more like this, where we can see that the embedding model now clearly separates posts based on their peak/pit classification (though we must be wary of overfitting!).\n\n\n\nFinetuned embedding model\n\n\nFinally, now we are happy with our model performance based on the training and validation datasets, we can evaluate the performance of this final model using our testing data. This is data that the model has never seen, and we are hoping that the accuracy and performance is similar to that of the validation data. This is Machine Learning 101 and if a refresher is needed for this there are plenty of resources online looking at the role of training, validation, and testing data.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Run inference over project data (Step 4)\nIt is finally time to infer whether the project data contain peaks or pits by using our fine-tuned SetFit model to classify the posts.\nBefore doing this again we need to make sure we do some data cleaning on the project specific data.\nBroadly, this needs to match the high-level cleaning we did during fine-tuning stage:\n\nMask brand/product mentions (using RoBERTa-based model [or similar] and Rivendell functions)\nRemove hashtags #️⃣\nRemove mentions 💬\nRemove URLs 🌐\nRemove emojis 🐙\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on social media sources\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently all peak and pit projects have been done on Twitter or Reddit data, but if a project includes web/forum data quirky special characters, numbered usernames, structured quotes etc. should also be removed.\n\n\n\nOkay now we can finally run inference. This is extremely simple and only requires a couple of lines of code (again see the Peaks and Pits Playbook for code implementation)\n\n\n3.2.5 The metal detector, GPT-3.5 (Step 5)\nDuring step 4 we obtained peak and pit classification using few-shot classification with SetFit. The benefit of this approach (as outlined previously) is its speed and ability to classify with very few labelled samples due to contrastive learning.\nHowever, during our iterations of peak and pit projects, we’ve realised that this step still classifies a fair amount of non-peak and pit posts incorrectly. This can cause noise in the downstream analyses and be very time consuming for us to further trudge through verbatims.\nAs such, the aim of this step is to further our confidence in our final list of peaks and pits to be actually peaks and pits. Remember before we explained that for SetFit, we focussed on recall being the most important measure in our business case? This is where we assume that GPT-3.5 enables us to remove the false positives due to it’s incredibly high performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy not use GPT from the start?\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing GPT-3.5 for inference, even over relatively few posts as in peaks and pits, is expensive both in terms of time and money. Preliminary tests have suggested it is in the order of magnitude of thousands of times slower than SetFit. It is for these reasons why we do not use GPT-x models from the get go, despite it’s obvious incredible understanding of natural language.\n\n\n\nWhilst prompt-based classification such as those with GPT-3.5 certainly has its drawbacks (dependency on prompt quality, prompt injections in posts, handling and version control of complex prompts, unexpected updates to the model weights rendering prompts ineffective), the benefits include increased flexibility in what we can ask the model to do. As such, in the absence of an accurate, cheap, and quick model to perform span detection, we have found that often posts identified as peaks/pits did indeed use peak/pit language, but the context of the moment was not related to the brand/product at the core of the research project.\nFor example, take the post that we identified in the project 706, looking for peaks and pits relating to PowerPoint:\n\nThis brings me so much happiness! Being a non-binary graduate student in STEM academia can be challenging at times. Despite using my they/them pronouns during introductions, emails, powerpoint presentations, name tags, etc. my identity is continuously mistaken. Community is key!\n\nThis is clearly a ‘peak’, however it is not accurate or valid to attribute this memorable moment to PowerPoint. Indeed, PowerPoint is merely mentioned in the post, but is not a core driver of the Peak which relates to feeling connection and being part of a community. This is as much a PowerPoint Peak as it is a Peak for the use of emails.\nTherefore, we can engineer our prompt to include a caveat to say that the specific peak or pit moment must relate directly to the brand/product usage (if relevant).\n\n\n3.2.6 Topic modelling to make sense of our data (Step 6)\nNow we have an extremely refined set of posts classified as either peak or pits. The next step is to identify what these moments actually relate to (i.e. identify the topics of these moments through statistical methods).\nTo do this, we employ topic modelling via BERTopic to identifying high-level topics that emerge within the peak and pit conversation. This is done separately for each product and peak/pit dataset (i.e. there will be one BERTopic model for product A peaks, another BERTopic model for product A pits, an additional BERTopic model for product B peaks etc).\nWe implement BERTopic using the R package BertopicR. As there is already good documentation on BertopicR this section will not go into any technical detail in regards to implementation.\nFrom BertopicR. we end up with a topic label for each post in our dataset, meaning we can easily quantify the size of each topics and visualise temporal patterns of topic volume etc.\n\n\n\nScreenshot from a Peaks and Pits project showcasing the identified Peak moments for a product at a high level\nSchematic workflow from Project 706 - Peaks and Pits in M365 Apps\nUn-finetuned embedding model\nFinetuned embedding model",

    "text": "4.1 Project Background\nWorking with semi-structured or unstructured high-dimensional data, such as text (and in our case, social media posts), poses significant challenges in measuring or quantifying the language used to describe any specific phenomena. One common approach to quantifying language is topic modelling, where a corpus (or collection of documents) is processed and later represented in neater and simplified format. This often involves displaying top terms, verbatims, or threads highlighting any nuances or differences within the data. Traditional topic modelling or text analysis methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), operate on the probability or likelihood of terms or n-grams belonging to a set number of topics.\nThe Conversation Landscape workflow offers a slightly different solution and one that partitions text data without a specific need for burdening the user with sifting through rows of data in order to segment documents with hopes of understanding or recognising any differences in language, which would ideally be defined more simply as topics. The is mostly achieved through sentence transforming, where documents are converted from words to numerical values, which are often referred to as ‘embeddings’. These values are calculated based on their content’s semantic and syntactic properties. The transformed values are then processed again using dimension reduction techniques, making the data more suitable for visualisation. Typically, this involves reducing to two dimensions, though three dimensions may be used to introduce another layer of abstraction between our data points. The example provided throughout this chapter, represents some text data as nodes upon a two-dimensional space.",

While the example output provided displays a simplified means for visualising complex and multifaceted noisy data such as the ‘Artificial Intelligence’ conversation on social, there are a number of steps that one must take carefully and be mindful of throughout, in order to create the best fit model appropriate for a typical Conversation Landscape project.\nThe broad steps would include, and as one might find across many projects within the realms of Natural Language Processing (NLP):\n\nInitial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Checking that the data is relevant and fit to answer the brief.\nCleaning and Processing: Removal of spam, unhelpful or irrelevant data, and pre-processing of text variable for embedding.\nTransforming/Embedding: Turning our words into numbers which will later be transformed again before being visualised.\nDimension Reduction: Reducing our representational values of documents to a manageable state in order to visualise.\nTopic Modelling/Clustering: Scientifically modelling and defining our data into a more digestible format.\n\n\n4.3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\nWhether the user is responsible for data querying/collection or not, the first steps in our workflow should always involve some high-level checks before we proceed with any of the following steps in order to save time downstream and give us confidence to carry over into the data cleaning and processing steps and beyond.\nFirst, one should always check things like the existing variables and clean or rename any where necessary. This step requires a little forward thinking as to what columns are necessary to complete each stage of the project. Once happy with our variables, we can then check for things such as missing dates, and/or if there are any abnormal distributions across columns like ‘Social Platform’ that might skew any findings or help us understand or perhaps justify the resulting topic model. Next, we can do some bespoke or project specific checks like searching for likely-to-find terms or strings within our text variable to ensure that the data is relevant and query has captured the phenomena we are aiming to model.\n\n\n4.3.2 Data Cleaning/Processing:\nAgain, as we may not always be responsible for data collection, we can expect that our data may contain unhelpful or even problematic information which is often the result of data being unwillingly bought in by the query. Our job at this stage is to minimize the amount of unhelpful data existing in our corpus to ensure our findings are accurate as well as appropriate for the data which we will be modelling.\nOptimal procedures for spam detection and removal are covered in more detail here. However, there are steps the user absolutely must take to ensure that the text variable which will be provided to the sentence transformer model is clean and concise so that an accurate embedding process can take place upon our documents. This includes the removal of:\n\nHashtags #️⃣\nUser/Account Mentions 💬\nURLs or Links 🌐\nEmojis 🐙\nNon-English Characters 🉐\n\nOften, we might also choose to remove punctuation and/or digits, however in our provided example, we have not done so. There are also things to beware of such as documents beginning with numbers that can influence the later processes, so unless we deem them necessary we should remove these where possible to ensure no inappropriate grouping of documents takes place based on these minor similarities. This is because when topic modelling, we aim to capture the pure essence of clusters which is ultimately defined by the underlying semantic meaning of documents, as apposed to any similarities across the chosen format of said documents.\n\n\n4.3.3 Sentence Transforming/Embedding:\nOnce we are happy with the cleanliness and relevance of our data, including the processing steps we have taken with our chosen text variable, we can begin embedding our documents so that we have a numerical representation that can later be reduced and visualised for each. Typically, and in this case we have used already pre-trained sentence transformer models that are hosted on Hugging Face, such as all-mpnet-base-v2 which is the specific model we had decided to use in our AI Conversation Landscape example. This is because during that time, the model had boasted great performance scores for how lightweight it was, however with models such as these being open-source, community-lead contributions are made to further train and improve model performance which means that these performance metrics are always increasing, so one may wish to consult the Hugging Face leaderboard, or simply do some desk research before settling on an ideal model appropriate for their own specific use case.\nWhile the previous steps taken might have involved using R and Rstudio and making use of SHARE’s suite of data cleaning, processing and parsing functionality, the embedding process will need to be completed using Google Colab. This is to take advantage of their premium GPUs and high RAM option, as embedding documents can require large amounts of compute, so much so that most fairly competent machines with standard tech specs will struggle. It is also worth noting that an embedding output may depend on the specific GPU being utilized as well as the version of Python that Colab is currently running, it’s good practice to make note of both of these specifics, along with other modules and library versions that one may wish to use in the same session, such as umap-learn (you may thank yourself at a later stage for doing so). To get going with sentence transformers and for downloading/importing a model such as all-mpnet-bas-v2, there are step-by-step guides purposed to enable users with the know-how to use them and deal with model outputs upon the Hugging Face website.\n\n\n4.3.4 Dimension Reduction:\nAt this stage, we would expect to have our data cleaned along with the representative embeddings for each document, which is output by the sentence transforming process. This next step, explains how we take this high-dimensional embeddings object and then simplify/reduce columns down enough to a more manageable size in order to map our documents onto a semantic space. Documents can then be easily represented as a node and are positioned within this abstract space based upon their nature, meaning that those more semantically similar will be situated closer together upon our two (or sometimes three-dimensional) plot, which then forms our landscape.\nThere are a number of ways the user can process an embeddings output. Each method has its own merits as well as appropriate use cases, which mostly depend whether the user intends to focus on either the local or global structure of their data. For more on the alternative dimension reduction techniques, the BERTopic documentation provides some further detail while staying relevant to the subject matter of Topic Modelling and NLP.\nOnce we have reduced our embeddings, and for the sake of staying consistent to the context of our given example, lets say we have decided to use Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a technique which is helpful for when we wish to represent both the local and global structures of our data. The output of this step should have resulted in taking our high dimensional embedding data (often 768 columns or sometimes more) and reduced these values down to just 2 columns so that we can plot them onto our semantic space (our conversation landscape plot), using these 2 reduced values as if to serve as X and Y coordinates to appropriately map each data point, we often name these two columns V1 and V2.\nAt this stage, we can use the LandscapeR package to render a static visualisation of the entire landscape, and we can select the desired colour of our nodes by making use of the fill_colour parameter. In this instance, we’ve mapped our documents onto the semantic space represented as nodes using columns V1 and V2 and coloured them a dark grey.\n\ndata %&gt;% \n  LandscapeR::ls_plot_static(x_var = V1,\n                             y_var = V2,\n                             fill_colour = \"#808080\")\n\n\n\n\nGrey Colourless Landscape Plot from an AI Landscape Microsoft Project - Q2 FY24\n\n\nIt’s worth pointing out, that there are a number of ways for the user to interactively explore the landscape at this stage by scanning over each node, checking the documents contents. This helps the user to familiarise with each region of the landscape before clustering. The plotly package serves as a user friendly means for this purpose, helping us gather a ‘lay of the land’ and identify the dense and not so dense sections of our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows just a 20K sample from our data, which is done only to comply with data size limits on GitHub and to be more conservative with compute and memory usage. Here, we also use a message column with breaks every 10 words to ensure the visual is neater.\n\n\n\n\ndata %&gt;% plotly::plot_ly(\n  x = ~V1,\n  y = ~V2,\n  type = 'scatter',\n  mode = 'markers',\n  marker = list( color = '#808080', size = 1),\n  text = ~paste('Message: ', message_with_breaks),\n  hoverinfo = 'text'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Topic Modelling/Clustering:\nThe final steps taken are arguably the most important, this is where we will define our documents and simplify our findings byway of scientific means, in this case using Topic Modelling.\nThere are a number of algorithms that serve this purpose, but the more commonly used clustering techniques are KMeans and HDBSCAN. However, the example we have shown uses KMeans, where we define the number of clusters that we would expect to find beforehand and perform clustering on either the original embeddings object output by the sentence transformer model, or we can reduce those embeddings to something much smaller like 10 dimensions and cluster documents based on those. If we were to opt for HDBSCAN however, we would allow the model to determine how many clusters were formed based on some input parameters such as min_cluster_size which are provided by the user. For more on these two techniques and when/how to use them in a topic modelling setting, we can consult the BERTopic documentation once more.\nIt’s also worth noting that this step requires a significant amount of human interpretation, so the user can definitely expect to partake in an iterative process of trial and error, trying out different values for the clustering parameters which determine the models output, with hopes of finding the model of best fit, which they feel accurately represents the given data.\nIn practise, this visualisation can be derived using our original data object with topic/cluster information appended, as well as the original V1 and V2 coordinates that we had used previously. To ensure our topics are coloured appropriately, we can create and use a named character vector and some additional ggplot2 syntax to manually assign topics with specific hex codes or colours.\n\n# assign colours to topics\ntopic_colours &lt;- c(\"Ethics & Regulation\" = \"#C1E1C1\",\n                   \"Technological Innovations\" = \"#6e88db\", \n                   \"AI in an Artistic Domain\" = \"#7e2606\",\n                   \"Cultural & Social Impact\" = \"#ff6361\",\n                   \"Business & Wider-Markets\" = \"#063852\",\n                   \"Future of Learning & Personal Growth\" = \"#ffa600\",\n                   \"Future of Work & Security\" = \"#9e1ad6\"\n                   )\n\n\ndata %&gt;% \n  LandscapeR::ls_plot_group_static(x_var = V1,\n                                   y_var = V2,\n                                   group_var = topic_name) +\n  ggplot2::scale_colour_manual(values = topic_colours) # colour nodes manually\n\n\n\n\nSegmented Colourful Landscape Plot from an AI Landscape Microsoft Project - Q2 FY24",

    "title": "4  Conversation Landscape",
    "section": "4.4 Downstream Flourishes",
    "text": "4.4 Downstream Flourishes\nWith the basics of each step covered, we will now touch on a few potentially beneficial concepts worth grasping that may help us overcome anything else that may occur when working within the Conversation Landscape project domain.\n\n4.4.1 Model Saving & Reusability:\nOccasionally, a client may want us to track topics over time or perform a landscape change analysis. In these cases, we need to save both our Dimension Reduction and Clustering models so that new data can be processed using these models, tp produce consistent and comparable results.\nThis requires careful planning. When we initially reduce embeddings and perform clustering, we use the .fit() method from sklearn when either reducing the dimensions of or clustering on the original embeddings. This ensures that the models are trained on the data they are intended to represent, making future outputs comparable.\nWe had earlier, mentioned, that it is crucial to document the versions of the modules and Python interpreter used. When we reduce or cluster new data using our pre-fitted models, it is essential to do so with the exact same versions of important libraries and Python. The reason is that the internal representations and binary structures of the models can differ between versions. If we attempt to load and apply previously saved models with different versions, we risk encountering incompatibility errors. By maintaining version control and documenting the environment in which the models were created, we can ensure the reusability of our models. Overall, this practice allows for us to be accurate when tracking and comparing topics and noting any landscape changes.\n\n\n4.4.2 Efficient Parameter Tuning:\nWhen we’re performing certain steps within this workflow, more specifically the Dimension Reduction with likes of UMAP, or if we were to decide we’d want to cluster using HDBSCAN for example, being mindful of and efficient with tuning the different parameters at each step will definitely improve the outcome of our overall model. Therefore, understanding these key parameters and how they can interact will significantly enhance the performance of the techniques being used here.\n\n4.4.2.1 Dimension Reduction with UMAP:\nn_neighbors: This parameter controls the local neighborhood size used in UMAP. A smaller value focuses more on capturing the local structure, while a larger value considers more global aspects. Efficiently tuning this parameter involves considering the nature of your data and the scale at which you want to observe patterns.\nmin_dist: The min distance argument determines quite literally how tight our nodes are allowed to be positioned together within our semantic space, a lower value for this will mean nodes will be tightly packed together, whereas a higher number will ensure larger spacing of data points.\nn_components: Here is where we decide how many dimensions we wish to reduce our high-dimensional embeddings object down to, for visualisation we will likely set this parameter to a value of 2.\n\n\n4.4.2.2 KMeans CLustering\nn_clusters: KMeans is a relatively simple algorithm compared to other methods and components, requiring very little input. Here we just provide a value for the number of clusters we wish to form, this will either be clusters in the embeddings or a smaller, more manageable reduced embeddings object as mentiioned previously.\n\n\n4.4.2.3 HDBSCAN Clustering:\nmin_samples: This parameter defines the minimum number of points required to form a dense region. It helps determine the density threshold for clusters and can determine how conservative we want the clustering model to be. Put simply, a higher value can lead to fewer, larger clusters, while a lower value can result in more, smaller clusters.\nmin_cluster_size: This parameter sets the minimum size of clusters. Like min_samples it can directly influence the granularity of the clustering results. In this case, smaller values allow the formation of smaller clusters, while larger values prevent the algorithm from identifying any small clusters(or those below the size of the provided value). It’s worth noting that the relationship between min_samples and min_cluster_size is crucial. min_samples should generally be less than or equal to min_cluster_size. Adjusting these parameters in tandem helps us to control the sensitivity of HDBSCAN, and for us to define what qualifies as a cluster.\n\n\n4.4.2.4 Tip: Try starting with the default value for all of these parameters, and incrementally adjust based on the desired granularity or effect of any that we wish to amend.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Supporting Data Visualisation:\nOnce we have our landscape output, as shown in Final output of project, we will inevitably need to display some further information regarding our topics, most commonly; Volume over Time (VOT) and Sentiment Distribution for each.\nWhen doing so, we would ideally keep some formatting consistencies when plotting, as we mentioned previously, the colouring of our topics must remain the same throughout so that they match up with any previous representations in existing visuals such as the landscape output. We would also want to ensure that any plot we create orders our topics by volume or at least in the same order throughout our project. We can order our topics in terms of volume easily with just a few lines of code.\nFirst, we’ll make sure to set the factor levels of our topics by using dplyr::count() on the topic_name column, and setting the levels feature of the factor() base function based on the counted output.\n\n# sort topics by order of volume\ntopic_order &lt;- data %&gt;% dplyr::count(topic_name, sort = TRUE)\n# set levels determined by volume of topic, this orders the group variable for plotting\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  dplyr::mutate(topic_name = factor(topic_name, levels = topic_order$topic_name))\n\n\n4.4.3.1 Topic Volume over Time\nStarting with volume over time, we often choose to render a faceted plot that includes all topics and their VOT for comparison. We can do so by using functionality found in packages such as JPackage for this.\n\n# plot topic volume over time using 'plot_group_vol_time()' function\ndata %&gt;% \n  JPackage::plot_group_vol_time(group_var = topic_name,\n                                date_var = date,\n                                unit = \"day\",\n                                nrow = 2) +\n  ggplot2::scale_fill_manual(values = topic_colours) # apply colours manually!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3.2 Topic Sentiment Distribution\nNext, we might want/need to break each of our topics out by their sentiment distribution to help shine light on any of particular interest or to help us tell a more refined story using our topic model. This can be done by using the dr_plot_sent_group() function of the DisplayR package.\n\ndata %&gt;% \n  DisplayR::dr_plot_sent_group(group_var = topic_name,\n                               sentiment_var = sentiment,\n                               \"percent\", bar_labels = \"none\", \n                               sentiment_colours = c(\"POSITIVE\" = \"darkgreen\",\n                                                     \"NEGATIVE\" = \"darkred\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3.3 Alternative Visualisations\nWhile the two visuals we have displayed so far are relatively basic and commonly used, this does not mean that we won’t require alternative methods to display topic-level information. Often, we may render n-grams per topic to display the relationships that exist between terms/phrases, and we may create plots to showcase things such as data source or social network/platform distributions across topics.\nFinally, it’s worth noting that the need for specific data visualisation methods entirely depends on the project domain and brief, as well as any outcomes/findings derived throughout. This means we ought to be flexible in our approach to utilising any technique that may assist with strengthening our understanding of the data and/or supporting our analyses.\n\n\n\nScreenshot Taken from the Final Output of an AI Landscape Microsoft Project - Q2 FY24\nGrey Colourless Landscape Plot from an AI Landscape Microsoft Project - Q2 FY24\nSegmented Colourful Landscape Plot from an AI Landscape Microsoft Project - Q2 FY24",

    "section": "5.4 Components of a DS project",
    "text": "5.4 Components of a DS project\nDS projects consist of a parent project directory, with an associated .Rproj file, and three compulsory subdirectories code, data, and viz (all of which are made manually).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst there are no prizes for what goes in each subdirectory, it can be useful to have a structure in place to facilitate workflow ease.\n\n5.4.0.1 code\nWithin the code subdirectory is where all scripts should be kept. We utilise .Rmd (R Markdown) documents rather than basic .R scripts for our code.\nWe do this for a few reasons, but the main benefits include:\n\nIt acts as an environment in which to do data science- we can capture not only what we did, but importantly why we did it\nWe can easily build and export a variety of different output formats from a R Markdown document (PDF, HTML, slideshow etc)\n\nAs part of our commitment to literate programming, there are some good practices that we can implement at this level of abstraction.\nFirstly, do not have extremely long .Rmd documents, as this is no good for anybody. Instead split up your documents into different sections based on the purpose of the code.\nWhilst this can be a bit subjective, a good rule of thumb is to have a separate .Rmd for each aspect of a workflow. For example, we might have one .Rmd for reading in raw data, another for cleaning the data, another for EDA, and another for performing topic modelling etc.\nWe should also follow the tidyverse style guide in the naming of files, which states:\n\nIf files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers\n\nTherefore it makes sense to prefix our files, as we must load in the raw data before we can clean the data, and we must clean the data before we can perform certain analyses etc.\nSo we might have something like 00_load_data.Rmd, 01_clean_data.Rmd, 02_topic_modelling.Rmd.\n\n\n5.4.0.2 data\ndata is where we save any data file that comes from a project.\nThe vast majority of projects will involve analysing an export from a social listening platform, such as Sprinklr. Analysts will save the export in the form of .csv or .xlsx files on the Drive (not within the Data Science section). As Sprinklr limits its exports to 10k rows of data per export file, we often are presented with 10s/100s of files with raw mentions. Therefore once we read these files into R, it is a good opportunity to save them as an .Rds in the code folder using the function write_rds() to avoid having to reread the raw excel or csv files in again.\nIt is within data where you would also save cleaned datasets and the outputs of different analyses (not visualisations though). This is not limited to .Rds files, but could also be word documents, excel spreadsheets etc.\nAs projects get more complex with many analyses, it can be easy to clutter this subdirectory. As such, it is recommended to make folders within data to help maintain structure. This means it is easy to navigate where cleaned data is because it will be in a folder such as data/cleaned_data and a dataframe with topic labels would be in data/topic_modelling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave liberally\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, space is cheaper than time. If in doubt, save an intermediate dataframe after an analysis if you think you’ll need it in the future. It is better to run an analysis once and save the output to never look at it again, than to run an analysis, not save the output, and then need to rerun the analysis the following week.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.0.3 viz\nAny visualisation that is made throughout the project should be saved here. Again, this directory should be split into separate folders to keep different analyses separate, navigable, and clear. This is especially useful if there is are visualisations being made of the same analysis mapped over different variables or parameters, or if the project involves the analysis of separate products or brands.\nFor example, the below shows a screenshot of a viz folder for a project that looked at three products. Within viz the plots for each brand are in their own folder, and within each brand (chatgpt, copilot, gemini) there are further folders to split up the type of visualisations created (area_charts, eda etc), with even a third level of subdirectory (area_charts/peaks and area_charts/pits).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample viz directory hierarchy for a Peaks and Pits project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the data_science_project_work/ directory with client-specific subdirectories\nSteps to create a new project, taken from R for Data Science (2e) https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts.html#projects\nExample viz directory hierarchy for a Peaks and Pits project",

In fact, conservative estimates suggest we have 2-3 hours per day, or 4 hours on a good day, where we can work at maximum productivity on challenging tasks. Knowing that about ourselves, we should proactively introduce periods of high and low intensity to our days.\nIn periods of high intensity we’ll be problem solving - inspecting our data, selecting cleaning steps, running small scale experiments on our data: ‘What happens if I…’ and recording and interpreting the results. When the task is at the correct difficulty, you’ll naturally fall into a flow state. Try your best to prevent interruptions during this time. Protect your focus - don’t check your work emails, turn Slack off etc.\nWhilst these high-intensity periods are rewarding and hyper-productive, at the other end there is often a messy notebook or some questionable coding practices. Allocate time each and every day to revisit the code, add supporting comments, write assertions and tests, rename variables to be more descriptive, tidy up unused data artefacts, study your visualisations to understand what the data can really tell you etc. or anything else you can do to let your brain rest, recharge and come back stronger tomorrow. You’ll sometimes feel like you don’t have time to do these things, but it’s quite the opposite - you don’t have time not to do them.",

A naive strategy for reducing complexity is to reduce lines of code. But if we reduce the number of lines of code by introducing deeply nested function calls, the code becomes more complex not less as the number of lines decreases.\nAs a rough definition, let’s think of code complexity as ‘how difficult code is to reason about and work with.’ A good test of code complexity is how long it takes future you to remember what each line, or chunk, of code is for.\nWe’ll now explore some tools and heuristics for fighting complexity in our code.",

Structuring your projects and notebooks with this in mind will save many headaches.\n\n11.5.1 Readme\nFor each project, add aREADME.md or README.Rmd, here you can outline what and who the project is for and guide people to notebooks, data artefacts, and any important resources. You may find it useful to maintain a to-do list here, or provide high-level findings - it’s really up to you, just keep your audience in mind.\n\n\n11.5.2 Section Titles\n\n\nSection titles help order your thoughts - when done well they let you see the big picture of your document.

However, when rendering your document (which you should do regularly) it’s handy to have named chunks so that you know precisely which chunk is taking a long time to render, or has a problem. Furthermore, that 8-line pipe inside the chunk might not be as easy to understand at a glance in the future, and it certainly won’t be for your collaborators. It’s much easier to understand what a descriptively named chunk is doing than 8 piped function calls.",

More importantly than the time lost making the changes, you need to remember that the code has been duplicated and where all the copies are.\nWithout variables coding would be ‘nasty, brutish and short long.’. It’s difficult to find the Goldilocks zone between ‘more variables than I can possibly name’ and ‘YOLO the project title is typed out 36 times’.\nMagrittr’s pipe operator (%&gt;% or command + shift + m) can save you from having to create too many variables. It would be quite ugly if we had to always code like this:\n\nmpg_horesepower_bar_chart &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp))\n\nmpg_horesepower_bar_chart  &lt;- mpg_horesepower_bar_chart  + geom_point()\n\nmpg_horesepower_bar_chart  &lt;- mpg_horesepower_bar_chart  + labs(title = \"666 - Peaks & Pits - Xbox Horsepower vs Miles per Gallon\")\n\nmpg_horesepower_bar_chart \n\nInstead of this:\n\nmtcars %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"666 - Peaks & Pits - Xbox Horsepower vs Miles per Gallon\")\n\nPlace strings you’ll use a lot in variables at the top of your notebook, and then use the paste function, rather than cmd + c, to use the contents of the variable where necessary.

But some repetition is natural, desirable, and harmless whereas attempts to avoid all repetition can be the opposite. As a rule-of-thumb, if you write the same piece of code three times you should consider creating an abstraction.\nReasonable people disagree on the precise definition of ‘abstraction’ when it comes to coding & programming. For our needs, we’ll think about it as simplifying code by hiding some complexity. A good abstraction helps us to focus only on the important details, a bad abstraction hides important details from us.\nThe main tools for creating abstractions are:\n\nFunctions\nClasses\nModules\nPackages\n\nWe’ll focus on functions and packages.\n\n11.9.1 On functions\nMake them! There are lots of reasons to write your own functions and make your code more readable and re-usable. We can’t hope to cover them all here, but we want to impress their importance. Writing functions will help you think better about your code and understand it on a deeper level, as well as making it easier to read, understand and maintain.\nFor a more comprehensive resource, check in with the R4DS functions section\nAlso see the Tidyverse Design Guide for stellar advice on building functions for Tidyverse functions.\n\n\n11.9.2 On anonymous functions\nFunctions are particularly useful when you want to use iterators like {purrr}’s map family of functions or base R’s apply family. Often these functions are one-time use only so it’s not worth giving them a name or defining them explicitly, in which case you can use anonymous functions.\nAnonymous functions can be called in three main ways:\n\nUsing function() e.g. function(x) x + 2 will add 2 to every input\nUsing the new anonymous function notation: \\x x + 2\nUsing the formula notation e.g. map(list, ~.x + 2)\n\nYou will see a mixture of these, with 3. being used more often in older code, and 2. in more recent code.",

    "text": "12.1.1 Spam Removal\nWe use the term “spam” quite loosely in our data pre-processing workflows. Whilst the strict definition of “spam” could be something like “unsolicited, repetitive, unwanted content”, we can think of it more broadly any post that displays irregular posting patterns or is not going to provide analytical value to our research project.\n\n12.1.1.1 Hashtag filtering\nThere are multiple ways we can identify spam to remove it. The simplest is perhaps something like hashtag spamming, where an excessive number of hashtags, often unrelated to the content of the post, can be indicative of spam.\nWe can identify posts like this by counting the number of hashtags, and then filtering out posts that reach a certain (subjective) threshold.\n\ncleaned_data &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  mutate(extracted_hashtags = str_extract_all(message_column, \"#\\\\S+\"),\n         number_of_hashtags = lengths(extracted_hashtags)) %&gt;% \n  filter(number_of_hashtags &lt; 5)\n\nIn the example above we have set the threshold to be 5 (so any post that has 5 or more hashtags will be removed), however whilst this is a valid starting point, it is highly recommend to treat each dataset uniquely in determining which threshold to use.\n\n\n12.1.1.2 Spam-grams\nOften-times spam can be identified by repetitive posting of the same post, or very similar posts, over a short period of time.\nWe can identify these posts by breaking down posts into n-grams, and counting up the number of posts that contain each n-gram. For example, we might find lots of posts with the 6-gram “Click this link for amazing deals”, which we would want to be removed.\nTo do this, we can unnest our text data into n-grams (where we decide what value of n we want), count the number of times each n-gram appears in the data, and filter out any post that contains an n-gram above this filtering threshold.\nThankfully, we have a function within the LimpiaR package called limpiar_spam_grams() which aids us with this task massively. With this function, we can specify the value of n we want and the minimum number of times an n-gram should occur to be removed. We are then able to inspect the different n-grams that are removed by the function (and their corresponding post) optionally changing the function inputs if we need to be more strict or conservative with our spam removal.\n\nspam_grams &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  limpiar_spam_grams(text_var = message_column,\n                     n_gram = 6,\n                     min_freq = 6)\n\n# see remove spam_grams\nspam_grams %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"spam_grams\")\n\n# see deleted posts\nspam_grams %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"deleted\")\n\n# save 'clean' posts\nclean_data &lt;- spam_grams %&gt;% \n  pluck(\"data\")\n\n\n\n12.1.1.3 Filter by post length\nDepending on the specific research question or analysis we will be performing, not all posts are equal in their analytical potential. For example, if we are investigating what specific features contribute to the emotional association of a product with a specific audience, a short post like “I love product” (three words) won’t provide the level of detail required to answer the question.\nWhile there is no strict rule for overcoming this, we can use a simple heuristic for post length to determine the minimum size a post needs to be before it is considered informative. For instance, a post like “I love product, the features x and y excite me so much” (12 words) is much more informative than the previous example. We might then decide that any post containing fewer than 10 words (or perhaps 25 characters) can be removed from downstream analysis.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, exceedingly long posts can also be problematic. These long posts might contain a lot of irrelevant information, which could dilute our ability to extract the core information we need. Additionally, long posts might be too lengthy for certain pipelines. Many embedding models, for example, have a maximum token length and will truncate posts that are longer than this, meaning we could lose valuable information if it appears at the end of the post. Also, from a practical perspective, longer posts take more time to analyse and require more cognitive effort to read, especially if we need to manually identify useful content (e.g. find suitable verbatims).\n\n# Remove posts with fewer than 10 words\ncleaned_data &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(str_count(message_column, \"\\\\w+\") &gt;= 10)\n\n# Remove posts with fewer than 25 characters and more than 2500 characters\ncleaned_data &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  filter(str_length(message_column) &gt;= 25 & str_length(message_column) &lt;= 2500)\n\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Deduplication\nWhile removing spam often addresses repeated content, it’s also important to handle cases of exact duplicates within our dataset. Deduplication focuses on eliminating instances where entire data points, including all their attributes, are repeated.\nA duplicated data point will not only have the same message_column content but also identical values in every other column (e.g., universal_message_id, created_time, permalink). This is different from spam posts, which may repeat the same message but will differ in attributes like universal_message_id and created_time.\nAlthough the limpiar_spam_grams() function can help identify spam through frequent n-grams, it might not catch these exact duplicates if they occur infrequently. Therefore, it is essential to use a deduplication step to ensure we are not analysing redundant data.\nTo remove duplicates, we can use the distinct() function from the dplyr package, ensuring that we retain only unique values of universal_message_id. This step guarantees that each post is represented only once in our dataset.\n\ndata_no_duplicates &lt;- data %&gt;% \n  distinct(universal_message_id, .keep_all = TRUE)",

    "section": "12.2 Document-level cleaning",
    "text": "12.2 Document-level cleaning\nGoal: Prepare each individual document (post) for text analysis.\nAt a document-level (or individual post level), the steps that we take are more small scale. The necessity to perform each cleaning step will depend on the downstream analysis being performed, but in general the different steps that we can undertake are:\n\n12.2.1 Remove punctuation\nOften times we will want punctuation to be removed before performing an analysis because they tend to not be useful for text analysis. This is particularly the case with more ‘traditional’ text analytics, where an algorithm will assign punctuation marks a unique numeric identify just like a word. By removing punctuation we create a cleaner dataset by reducing noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning on punctuation\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more complex models, such as those that utilise word or sentence embeddings, we often keep punctuation in. This is because punctuation is key to understanding a sentences context (which is what sentence embeddings can do).\nFor example, there is a big difference between the sentences “Let’s eat, Grandpa” and “Let’s eat Grandpa”, which is lost if we remove punctuation.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.2 Remove stopwords\nStopwords are extremely common words such as “and,” “the,” and “is” that often do not carry significant meaning. In text analysis, these words are typically filtered out to improve the efficiency of text analytical models by reducing the volume of non-essential words.\nRemoving stopwords is particularly useful in our projects for when we are visualising words, such as a bigram network or a WLO plot, as it is more effective if precious informative space on the plots is not occupied by these uninformative terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning on stopword removal\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly to the removal of punctuation, for more complex models (those that utilise word or sentence embeddings) we often keep stopwords in. This is because these stopwords can be key to understanding a sentences context (which is what sentence embeddings can do).\nFor example, imagine if we removed the stopword “not” from the sentence “I have not eaten pizza”- it would become “I have eaten pizza” and the whole context of the sentence would be different.\nAnother time to be aware of stopwords is if a key term related to a project is itself a stopword. For example, the stopwords list SMART treats the term “one” as a stopword. If we were studying different Xbox products, then the console “Xbox One” would end up being “Xbox” and we would lose all insight referring to that specific model. For this reason it is always worth double checking which stopwords get removed and whether it is actually suitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.3 Lowercase text\nConverting all text to lowercase standardises the text data, making it uniform. This helps in treating words like “Data” and “data” as the same word, and is especially useful when an analysis requires an understanding of the frequency of a term (we rarely want to count “Data” and “data” as two different things) such as bigram networks.\n\n\n12.2.4 Remove mentions\nMentions (e.g., @username) are specific to social media platforms and often do not carry significant meaning for text analysis, and in fact may be confuse downstream analyses. For example, if there was a username called @I_love_chocolate, upon punctuation remove this might end up confusing a sentiment algorithm. Removing mentions therefore helps in focusing on the actual content of the text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetaining mentions, sometimes\n\n\n\n\n\nWe often perform analyses that involve network analyses. For these, we need to have information of usernames because they appear when users are either mentioned or retweeted. In this case we do not want to remove the @username completely, but rather we can store this information elsewhere in the dataframe.\nHowever, broadly speaking if the goal is to analyse the content/context of a paste, removing mentions is very much necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.5 Remove URLs\nURLs in posts often point to external content and generally do not provide meaningful information for text analysis. Removing URLs helps to clean the text by eliminating these irrelevant elements.\n\n\n12.2.6 Remove emojis/special characters\nEmojis and special characters can add noise to the text data. While they can be useful for certain analyses (like emoji-specific sentiment analysis - though we rarely do this), they are often removed to simplify text and focus on word-based analysis.\n\n\n12.2.7 Stemming/Lemmatization\nStemming and lemmatization are both techniques used to reduce words to their base or root form and act as a text normalisation technique.\nStemming trims word endings to their most basic form, for example changing “clouds” to “cloud” or “trees” to “tree”. However, sometimes stemming reduces words to a form that doesn’t make total sense such as “little” to “littl” or “histories” to “histori”.\nLemmatization considers the context and grammatical role when normalising words, producing dictionary definition version of words. For example “histories” would become “history”, and “caring” would become “car” (whereas for stemming it would become “car”).\nWe tend to use lemmatization over stemming- despite it being a bit slower due to a more complex model, the benefit of lemmitization outweighs this. Similar to lowercasing the text, lemmitization is useful when we need to normalise text where having distinct terms like “change”, “changing”, “changes”, and “changed” isn’t necessary and just “change” is suitable.",

    "text": "12.3 Conclusion\nDespite all of these different techniques, it is important to remember these are not mutually exclusive, and do not always need to be performed. It may very well be the case where a specific project actually required us to mine through the URLs in social posts to see where users a linking too, or perhaps keeping text as all-caps is important for how a specific brand or product is mentioned online. Whilst we can streamline the cleaning steps by using the ParseR function above, it is always worth spending time considering the best cleaning steps for each specific part of a project. It is much better spending more time at the beginning of the project getting this right, than realising that the downstream analysis are built on dodgy foundations and the data cleaning step needs to happen again later in the project, rendering intermediate work redundant.",

The second reason is to help you do this fast, and with confidence.\nTesting is not to prove that your code has no bugs, or cannot have any bugs in the future.

So what should we test? Echoing Einstein’s famous words on simplicity, tests should test everything the function does, nothing more and nothing less. Obviously we should check that our input validation is working, if we input 0 do we get an error, the same if we input a non-numeric. Then we should check a few return values, some that the function should return FALSE to and some that the function should return TRUE to. And then there’s a slightly less obvious test - our function has one argument and that argument is mandatory, i.e. it has no default value; if we’ve made this decision we should have made it for a reason, so we should test the function does error if no value is set.\nReminder that unit tests should:\nWriting tests may at times feel cumbersome, but only at the beginning. Once you’ve got a good test suite up development becomes more enjoyable - less anxiety associated with each change you make or feature you implement - and faster (trust!).

    "text": "10.1 What’s the problem?\nIdeally we want to test the three main components - the UI, the server, and the call to combine the two. The first obstacle is the UI, it’s not a function like we’re used to testing. And we don’t need to write a test to check that it’s still not a function going forwards, we let the Shiny developers write their own tests.\n\ninherits(ui, \"function\")\n\nI think it’s quite common to build Shiny apps without really knowing what a shiny.tag.list is, and that’s what a UI is.\n\nS3Class(ui)\n\nAnd then there’s the slightly puzzling unnamed list which has 4 elements\n\nlength(ui); names(ui)\n\nWhat are the elements, and what kinds of test can we run on them?\n\nui[[1]]\nui[[2]]\nui[2]\nui[3]\nclass(ui[4][[1]][[1]])\n\nWe’ll come back to this shortly.\nThe next problem is the server object - which is a function - but a slightly esoteric one.\n\nS3Class(server)\n\nIt takes three mandatory arguments - input, output, and session. The input argument is quite transparent - we use it to access inputs all the time when building Shiny apps, and similar for outputs with the output$ object. As we can index them with $ we think they’re probably named lists of some description. But session is a little more opaque.\n\nformals(server)\n\nSo we know that if we want to test the server function we’ll need to add input, output, and session but we don’t really know what we should add there. Like the UI, we’ll come back to this shortly.\nSo the shinyApp function, which has a more familiar look about it. It takes our ui and server as inputs, and builds the Shiny app for us. Source code:\n\nfunction (ui, server, onStart = NULL, options = list(), uiPattern = \"/\", \n    enableBookmarking = NULL) \n{\n    if (!is.function(server)) {\n        stop(\"`server` must be a function\", call. = FALSE)\n    }\n    uiPattern &lt;- sprintf(\"^%s$\", uiPattern)\n    httpHandler &lt;- uiHttpHandler(ui, uiPattern)\n    serverFuncSource &lt;- function() {\n        server\n    }\n    if (!is.null(enableBookmarking)) {\n        bookmarkStore &lt;- match.arg(enableBookmarking, c(\"url\", \n            \"server\", \"disable\"))\n        enableBookmarking(bookmarkStore)\n    }\n    appOptions &lt;- captureAppOptions()\n    structure(list(httpHandler = httpHandler, serverFuncSource = serverFuncSource, \n        onStart = onStart, options = options, appOptions = appOptions), \n        class = \"shiny.appobj\")\n}\n\nThere’s some input validation,\ninputs is a list of reactiveValues, output is a list of some values too. Session is… a bit different. And how do we access it programmatically?\nLater - refactor to have min &gt; 0, as why would you want 0 breaks and to allow the erro?",

For example, if a user posts something like “I love X product for Y reason…”, we’d almost definitely expect to see this document ascribed with a ‘Positive’ sentiment. The waters can become quite murky when dealing with sarcasm, jokes or trending language or jargon that machines struggle to classify/understand fully. These classifications can come already baked into a dataset that we’d export from platforms like Sprinklr or Radarly.",

This section will serve to break those steps down into a more manageable and easy to follow pipeline.\n\nData Processing: A inevitable step to take is the pre-processing and preparation of our data which will set us up for gathering more meaningful insights downstream, with findings more representative of the true nature of our data.\nSentiment Classification: While we can’t be sure of where our data will come from in any project, it’s useful (and sometimes optimal) for us to get our own classifications using pre-trained classifiers that are hosted on open source platforms such as HuggingFace.\nAnalyse Outcome: Analyse the sentiment of the entire dataset first, make note of any heavy skews in Positivity or Negativity. Compare or contrast this to any topic model or segmented data and the sentiment within those.\nVisualise and Report: Finally, create meaningful visualisations to portray findings derived from the analysis that illustrate the overall sentiment distribution. Compile the visuals highlighting the insights and key trends that we have observed.",

However, it is crucial to ensure high data quality when performing any analysis, especially when analysing sentiment. Unclean data can significantly distort sentiment distributions. For example, spam and promotional content often found on social media tend to skew positively due to their use of overly enthusiastic and optimistic language.

    "section": "7.4 Sentiment Classification",
    "text": "7.4 Sentiment Classification\nAs we mentioned earlier, most (if not all) datasets we receive from Sprinklr or Radarly will contain some sentiment or similar information related to a post or document. However, we may wish to calculate our own classifications using out-of-the-box pre-trained models or even a classifier we build ourselves. This section will cover a straightforward process for doing so using a pre-trained model from HuggingFace. Each step will be performed using Python modules, with a simple code layout provided throughout, making it easy to follow.\n\n7.4.1 Import Model\nFirst, we’ll import any modules/libraries that we may need for the workflow as well as the sentiment model. In this instance, we will use the twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest model which has been trained on Twitter data and can be retrieved via the transformers module. We will make use of the pandas library for any data manipulation steps.\n\n# {Python Code}\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport pandas as pd \n\n# import model from transformers using pipeline and \nsentiment_model = pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\", model=\"cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest\")\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Data\nTo perform any kind of text classification, we need texts, so here we will create some data with a column ‘message’ to resemble a real-world example.\n\n# {Python Code}\n# create a dataframe object with one Positive, Negative and Neutral 'message' to classify\ndata = {\n    \"doc_id\": list(range(1, 6)),\n    \"message\": [\n      \"I love using this product, it has changed my life.\",\n      \"A really good product\",\n      \"A good product\",\n      \"This product sucks so bad, don't waste your money\",\n      \"Very unhappy with the service, it was a disaster.\",\n      \"I can't recommend this product enough!\",\n      \"I haven't used it yet, heard it works though\"\n      ]\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nFor demonstrative purposes, we’ve used a manually constructed dataframe, but it’s likely the user will need something like this to import their data:\ndata = pd.read_csv('input/the/path/to/the/files/directory.csv')\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Classify Documents\nNow we have some data, let’s look at how we classify texts and retrieve the desired output. First, we’ll ensure the column containing our documents is isolated and in the correct format, as a string type list. We can then provide this object to the model so it can perform sentiment classification on each row of data(or document).\n\n# {Python Code}\ntexts = data['message'].astype(str).tolist() # make sure texts is a list of type string\nsentiment_output = sentiment_model(texts) # using the imported model, derive sentiment classifications\n\n# display the results...\nsentiment_output\n\n[{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9894090890884399},\n {'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9547233581542969},\n {'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9378408193588257},\n {'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.983325719833374},\n {'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6355203986167908}]\n\n\n\n7.4.4 Handling Output\nIn our use-case example here, we see the model label posts positive, negative or neutral as we might have expected to, but also provide a score with it, where numbers closer to 1 are considered higher and more fitting to the label.\nSo now we have our labels and confidence scores for each classification, we can go ahead and either save them individually or join them to our original data and then save them for later use. Here’s how we’d perform the second option, of joining to the original data-frame.\n\n# {Python Code}\n# isolate labels and scores\nlabels = [output['label'] for output in sentiment_output]\nscores = [output['score'] for output in sentiment_output]\n\n# add sentiment and scores to the original df\ndf['hf_sentiment'] = labels\ndf['hf_sentiment_score'] = scores\n\nAs we normally do a lot of our work using Rstudio and often set up directories based around R projects, we may wish to save this output in CSV format, so that the later stages such as visualisation can be performed by any means.\n\n# {Python Code}\n# save dataframe\ndf.to_csv(\"/path/to/your/project/folder/name_of_data.csv\", index=False)",

    "text": "11.11 On namespaces and function conflicts\nR manages functions via namespaces. Depending on the order that you import your packages, you may find a function doesn’t behave as expected. For example, the {stats} package has a filter() function, but so does {dplyr}. By default R will use the most recently-imported package’s namespace to avoid any conflicts, so filter() will now refer to {dplyr}’s implementation.\nIf you’re experiencing weirdness with a function, you may want to restart your R session, change the order of your imports to prevent the same weirdness occurring again. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the package:: notation to explicitly refer to the function you intended to use e.g. dplyr::filter() will avoid any potential conflicts and confusion.",

    "section": "11.13 On Managing Dependencies",
    "text": "11.13 On Managing Dependencies\nApplying the Anna Karenina principle to virtual environments:\n\n“All happy virtual environments are alike; each unhappy virtual environment is unhappy in its own way”\n\n\n11.13.1 R\nThe R ecosystem - led by CRAN and posit (formerly RStudio) - does a great job in managing package-level dependencies. It’s rare to end up in dependency hell R. However, there is still scope for ‘works on my machine’ when working with collaborators who have different versions of a package, e.g. person 1 upgrades their {dplyr} version before person 2, and now that .by argument person 1 has used is breaking code on person 2’s machine.\nTo avoid this, we advise using something like the {renv} package to manage package versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn using renv collaboratively\n\n\n\n\n\nrenv helps us keep track of package & R versions, which makes deployment 10x easier than without it. However, it can get tricky if we’re using renv in different ways.\nStart a renv project off withrenv::init(), this will essentially remove all of your packages. You could choose to take your current packages with you, but it’s not advised. These packages are linked to your RStudio project when using RStudio, which means other RStudio projects will have your current packages if they’re not themselves using renv.\nrenv::init() creates a renv lockfile, you’ll need to keep this up to date as you work through the project - especially important if collaborating with other people on a project that uses renv. Once installed inside your local project, you can add single packages to the lockfile by renv::record(\"package_name\"). This is preferable to adding a bunch of packages at a time with renv::snapshot() particularly when collaborating. Generally it will be better to give one person control of the lockfile and to communicate about adding packages as and when.\nIf you’re working in a Quarto Doc or an RMarkdownfile to develop things that don’t need to pushed to the repo, you can create a .renvignore file like .Rbuildignore, .gitignore etc. and add the folder where the markdowns sit to make sure renv doesn’t try to sync itself with the packages you’re experimenting with.\nAt any time you can check your environment is still synced with renv::status(), if your project is out of sync, you may want to renv::clean(), if you’ve got a bunch of packages that are like this:\nThe following package(s) are in an inconsistent state:\npackage       installed recorded used\nbackports     y         y        n\nblob          y         y        n\nbroom         y         y        n\ncallr         y         y        n\ncellranger    y         y        n\nThen you’ll need to renv::clean(actions = \"unused.packages\"), which should get you in working order. There’s a lot more to {renv} when collaborating but these steps will do a lot to keep your environment in sync and allow collaborators to use your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.13.2 Python\n\nUnlike R, it’s pretty easy to get into deep, deep trouble when working with Python environments. We advise using miniconda, keeping your base environment completely free of packages, and creating virtual environments for projects or large, but commonly-used and important packages like torch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nJust remember to activate the correct environment every time you need to install a package!",
